# SASS-App-Boiler-PlateA simple SASS boilerplate for tackling any web-based project.Takes advantage of the following:- [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) - JavaScript task runner to help automate tasks.- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - SASS framework extension.- [Jeet.GS](http://jeet.gs) -  Flexible Grid System. Jeet allows you to express your page grid the same way a human would describe it. No more needlessly nesting elements. No more rigid twelve column rules. Enjoy building faster with less code, and more flexibility with Jeet. - [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) - file synchronization, style injection, and more.## Installing Project PackagesYou will need to install the following:1. Install NodeJS	- https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node	- make sure NPM in updated to the latest version by running `sudo npm install npm -g`2. Install Compass	- 1) install [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rubyinstaller) (required for Compass to run)		- 2) `$ gem update --system`	- 3) `$ gem install compass`3. Install GulpJS Globally	- `npm install -g gulp `4. Install "SASS-App-Boiler-Plate" NPM modules	- `npm install`5. All assets are ready. You can modify the gulpfile to your liking.## How it Works / How to Use / Notes> *quick start*: run `gulp` and then edit SASS files in `/components/sass` folder. CSS appears in App folder and browser injects new styles. Don't forget about implementing [beautiful grid systems](http://jeet.gs).- After Project Packages are installed you can run the default task via `gulp`. Default just runs `sass-to-css` then `browser-sync` task.- SASS files are located in `./components/sass/`. - Jeet Functions and Mixins are located within the SASS folder and are loaded as a SASS `@import` directive.- Load base SASS partials via `./components/sass/styles.scss`. Example partials have been created.- Always underscore SASS partials when naming them: `_variables.scss` and load partials w/o underscore or extension `@import "partials/variables"`.- The `sass-to-css` task will catch and throw errors to the console without disrupting the `watch` tasks and alert user with 3 consecutive and distinct beeps, keeping you actively aware of SASS/CSS errors.- Sourcemaps are created by default. If you don't use them, disable them since it takes additional processing time.- Although this is a simple SASS boilerplate, a JavaScript folder and uglify/beautify tasks have been created but not enabled by default. Uncomment the jsSources watch method(_within the `browser-sync` task_) to uglify/beautify JS from the components folder to the app folder.- CSS can be uglified by changing `gulp.watch(sassSources, ['sass-to-css']);` to `gulp.watch(sassSources, ['css-uglify']);`- The `browser-sync` task serves files from the "server" object's `baseDir` parameter. Alternatively, serve the App base directory from an _existing_ vhost by removing the `server` object and uncommenting the `proxy` parameter. Browsersync will wrap the vhost with a proxy.- uncommenting the tunnel parameters within the `browser-sync` task will let you serve your files over the net. Just be sure it's nothing sensitive!- a few Compass import directives are included. Add/remove to your liking. Note: The sample `index.html` includes use of the `compass/layout/sticky-footer` module.
